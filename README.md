A manager for resources in Kubernetes. The tool allows for monitoring and managing some of the standard Kubernetes resources (PersistentVolumeClaim, Services, Deployments, Jobs, and Secrets) as well as for managing a selection of Custom Resources.

## Quick start

To run locally the application in development mode, Java 17+ and Node.JS are required.

### Back-end
Create an `application-local.yaml` file under `src/main/resources` and configure it as follows (notably, change `kubernetes.config` to point to your local configuration file):

``` yaml
#kubernetes
kubernetes:
  namespace: postgrest-operator-system
  config: file:///Users/your_user/.kube/config
  crd:
    allowed:
    denied: >
  selector:
    service: 

# authentication and authorization config
auth:
  basic:
    username: user
    password: password
  oauth2:
    issuer-uri: https://aac.platform.smartcommunitylab.it
    audience: client_id_for_auth2
    role-claim: krmrole

security.cors.origins: http://localhost:3000
```

Start the server:
```
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
```

The server and API is available at ``http://localhost:8080/`` with Swagger documentation enabled (``/swagger-ui/index.html``).

### Front-end
Create a `.env.development` file under `frontend` and configure it as follows:
```
PUBLIC_URL="/"
REACT_APP_CONTEXT_PATH="/"
REACT_APP_AUTH = "basic"
REACT_APP_API_URL = "http://localhost:8080"
REACT_APP_AUTHORITY = ""
REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID = ""
REACT_APP_APPLICATION_URL = "http://localhost:3000"
REACT_APP_AUTH_CALLBACK_PATH = "/auth-callback"
REACT_APP_SCOPE = "openid profile"
```

Then, run the front-end (make sure to `cd` to `frontend` first):
```
npm start
```

You may receive an error if authentication is not configured for npm. Try configuring `frontend/.npmrc` as follows (set `authToken`):
```
always-auth=true
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=your_token
registry=https://registry.yarnpkg.com/ # for yarn

@smartcommunitylab:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

A browser page pointing to `localhost:3000` should automatically open. If you didn't change credentials, log in with `user` and `password`.

### Creating a schema from the UI

Go to *Settings* and pick a *CRD*. You can leave the *Schema* field empty and click *Save*, and the schema enabled in Kubernetes will be automatically picked up. However, you need to go edit the generated schema to add the following property at root level, otherwise you will be unable to manage the corresponding CRs:
```
"$schema":"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"
```

## Configuration

### Back-end

Back-end configuration properties are defined in the ``src/main/resources/application.yml`` and may also be passed as the corresponding environment variables.

The configuration of the Kubernetes connection is defined with the ``kubernetes.config`` and the ``kubernetes.namespace`` properties. 

`kubernetes.crd.allowed` and `kubernetes.crd.denied` are meant to be mutually exclusive: you either specify one or the other (or leave both empty). Defining `allowed` will let the resource manager handle only the CRDs listed in it, while `denied` will allow all CRDs not listed in it. Leaving both empty lets the resource manager handle all CRDs. 

To control which standard resources are available to the Resource Manager, use the specific label selectors in the following way:

- `kubernetes.selector.service` (`K8S_SELECTOR_SERVICE`) defines the label selectors (separated by `|`) for filtering the K8S Services to read.
- `kubernetes.selector.deployment` (`K8S_SELECTOR_DEPLOYMENT`) defines the label selectors (separated by `|`) for filtering the K8S Deployments to read.
- `kubernetes.selector.job` (`K8S_SELECTOR_JOB`) defines the label selectors (separated by `|`) for filtering the K8S Jobs to read.
- `kubernetes.selector.pvc` (`K8S_SELECTOR_PVC`) defines the label selectors (separated by `|`) for filtering the K8S Persistent Volume Claims to read.
- `kubernetes.selector.quota` (`K8S_SELECTOR_QUOTA`) defines the label selectors (separated by `|`) for filtering the K8S to read.

KRM allows for accessing a subset of secrets. To define which secrets to access, it is possible to use the following properties

- `kubernetes.secret.labels` (`K8S_SELECTOR_LABELS`) defines the label selectors (separated by `|`) for filtering the K8S Secrets to match.
- `kubernetes.secret.owners` (`K8S_SELECTOR_OWNERS`) list of comma-separated owner api versions (full form) to match.
- `kubernetes.secret.annotations` (`K8S_SELECTOR_ANNOTATIONS`) defines the annotation filters (separated by `|`) for filtering the K8S Secrets to match. The filter should have a form `<annotation>=<value>`.
- `kubernetes.secret.name` (`K8S_SELECTOR_NAMES`) list of comma-separated regular expressionds to match the secret name.

The secrets will be shown only if at least one of these filters match.

To control the creation of the Persistent Volume Claims, it is possible additional to define the following properties

- `kubernetes.pvc.managed-by` to define the label to be associated with the K8S Resoruce Manager
- `kubernetes.pvc.storage-classes` to define a subset of Storage Classes that can be created with K*S Resource Manager. If not specified, all classes are allowed.

Other properties represent the typical Spring properties for the application configuration:

- ``auth.basic`` if the basic auth configuration is used (with the username and password)
- ``auth.oauth2`` if the OAuth2.0 authentication is used (with issuer URI to read metadata, audience allowed, claim to read the KRM role, and scopes to request)
- ``spring.datasource`` and ``spring.jpa`` to configure database connection
- ``server`` for the endpoint configuration
- ``management`` if management endpoints are enabled

### Front-end

Front-end configuration properties:

- ``PUBLIC_URL`` public path of the app
- ``REACT_APP_CONTEXT_PATH`` context path
- ``REACT_APP_AUTH`` auth type (basic or oauth2)
- ``REACT_APP_API_URL``  endpoint of the backend
- ``REACT_APP_APPLICATION_URL``  public app URL
- ``REACT_APP_AUTHORITY``  OAuth2.0 issuer (if enabled)
- ``REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID`` OAuth2.0 client id  (if enabled)
- ``REACT_APP_AUTH_CALLBACK_PATH``  OAauth2.0 callback address  (if enabled)
- ``REACT_APP_SCOPE`` OAuth2.0 scopes  (if enabled)

### Role-Based Access Control

In case OAuth2.0 authentication is enabled and role claim is defined, the user roles will be taken from the value of the claim (a comma-separated array is expected). Otherwise the user will only be associated ROLE_USER role. In other cases the RBAC is not enabled.

The permissions of the KRM may be defined at the level of a single resource  type. To associate different permissions to different roles, the
properties should contain the following block:

```
access:
  roles:
    - role: ROLE_MY_ROLE
      resources: k8s_service, k8s_secret::read, mycrd/example.com::write
```

In this way ``ROLE_MY_ROLE`` may perform the following operations:

- any operation on the ``k8s_service`` resource 
- list and read any K8S secret, 
- modify, read, and list `` mycrd/example.com`` CRs.

More specifically the following operations are supported

- ``list`` - read the list of objects 
- ``read`` - list and read any object
- ``write`` - write (create, modify, and delete), read and list

The syntax for the permission is the following: ``<resource>::<op>``. If operation is omitted, ``write`` all the operations are allowed. It is also possible to use
``*`` wildcard both for resources and for the operations.

To define the permissions on the K8S objects, the following resource type IDs are used:

- k8s_service
- k8s_job
- k8s_pvc
- k8s_secret
- k8s_deployment
- k8s_quota

The default configuration defines two roles 

- ``ROLE_USER`` with no access to resources
- ``ROLE_ADMIN`` with full access to resources

To overwrite these roles and permissions, it is possible to change the configuration in ``application.yaml`` or provide the corresponding environment variables as of Spring specification, e.g., 

```
ACCESS_ROLES_0_ROLE=ROLE_USER
ACCESS_ROLES_0_RESOURCES=k8s_service
ACCESS_ROLES_1_ROLE=ROLE_ADMIN
ACCESS_ROLES_1_RESOURCES=*
ACCESS_ROLES_2_ROLE=ROLE_K8S_MANAGER
ACCESS_ROLES_2_RESOURCES=k8s_service,k8s_job,k8s_pvc,k8s_secret,k8s_deployment
``` 

will allow for the ``ROLE_USER`` access to the list of K8S services, keep ``ROLE_ADMIN`` full access to all resouces, and grant ``ROLE_k8S_MANAGER`` full access to all base K8S resources.

## Development

The repo contains both the back-end code and the front-end.

The backend-application is implemented as a Java Spring Boot application (see ``src`` folder for the code). Dependencies are defined in ``pom.xml``.

The front-end application (``frontend`` folder) is implemented using React Admin framework. Dependencies are defined in ``frontend/package.json``.

See CONTRIBUTING for contribution instructions.
